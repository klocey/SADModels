SADModels
=========

Software to generate predicted forms of species abundance distributions via random fraction models, and analyze them against empirical patterns.
Developed by Nathan Hillis (University of Central Oklahoma) and Ken Locey (Indiana University).

What's a species abundance distribution? Glad you asked...

These are the directories and files in the repo...

Directories:

Files:

* In Models:
	* BrokenStick.py: code to generate random samples of both the sequential and simultaneous Broken Stick SAD models. Results match desired values of total abudance (N) and species richness (S). Accomplished by random fractioning of N into S parts as implied by both models.
	* BrokenStick.py: The Broken Stick model
	* RandFrac.py: The Random Fraction model
	* LogNormal.py: 
	* DominancePreemp.py:
	* Pareto.py
	* LogNormal_v2.py

* In Results:
	* Files generated by the scripts...and only files generated by scripts.

These are the programs or software you'll need to run the source code: 

* Python v? or higher
* ...


These are the many things the source will do:
