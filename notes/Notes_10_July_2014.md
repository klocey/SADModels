1. Feasible set paper? Could be part of thesis? That is, are the feasible sets behind ecological SAD models (when constrained by N and S) really that different from each other and/or different from the feasible set based on N and S?

This could also fit into the thesis. Easily stems from the computational work and collaboration with Ken.

Ken plans to write this, regardless. Question is, is it going to be Ken or Nathan as first author.


2. Q. What is Nathanâ€™s main question?
	A. Well, it was something about how (and why) temperature influences the form of 	the SAD. Is it perhaps easier/stronger/more feasible, interesting, direct, and 		timely to ask how (and why) the form of the SAD changes with area and N?

	Scale dependence issue of fit of SAD model to data. Is it Area or is it N; is Area 	a proxy for the effect of N?
	
	Q. Do we have the data.
	A. Yes? We have bird data from local to subcontinental scale?

	Note: #1 would feed directly into this.


Results from meeting:
	1. Think we have good code for generating (unbiased) random shapes of the RAD for the Simultaneous Broken Stick model. 
	   Function includes checks. Ken will test tonight to check for bias.
	2. Learned A LOT of impromptu coding lessons.
	3. Thought about the big question (above).
	4. Discussed Feasible set paper. If Nathan is in, he should read up on Locey and White (2013). Wikipedia: integer partition (combination), composition (permutation)
	5. If Nathan wants area to becomes a greater focus than temp, he should read up on the SAD vs. scale debate (how SAD changes); Ken already sent email and will send 
	   more pubs. Nathan will continue lit search.
