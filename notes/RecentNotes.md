#Recent Notes

What Ken did recently:

* Collapsed redundant files into a single file
	* Mainly dealing with RandFrac.py, RandFrac_1.py, & RandomFrac.py 	
* Changed import statements:
	* Probably don't need the csv module. Really only need it when there is special encoding that normal text parsing can't handle.
	
* Tweaked with files in Models directory to reflect that all 'things' in those files are either functions or classes of functions.

* Commented on Broken Stick Model, suggested tips for how to generate random samples from the Broken Stick "feasible set"
