#Figure one
* 3 x 2 Figure of 5 subplots of heat maps of random models
* 1 heat map of the feasible set of unique RAC shapes(Locey and White 2013)
* Total abundance of species = 1000 and species = 50 for all subplots

#Figure two
*	3 x 2 Figure of 6 subplots
*	Left side will compare Evenness(Evenness captures variance), Skewness and Kurtosis to total abundance
*	Right side will compare E,S,K to species richness
	
###Plot 1 - Relationship of Evenness to Total Abundance for Various Random Fraction Models
*	N = 1000
*	S = 2, 10, 20, 40, and so on to 640, 750, 850, 950
*	x axis - S
*	y axis - Average species evenness (Simpson's) from a random sample with standard error

###Plot 2 - Relationship of Skewness to Total Abundance 
*	N = 1000
*	S = 2, 10, 20, 40, and so on to 640, 750, 850, 950
*	x axis - S
*	y axis - Average skewness from a random sample with standard error

###Plot 3 - Relationship of Kurtosis to Total Abundance
#Figure three
###Plot 1 - heat map of broken stick and Max Like of Geometric series
*	Generate 1000 from Broken Stick
*	Compare to Geometric Series

###Plot 2 - heat map of logNormal and Max like of the logNormal constrained by average abundance and variance
