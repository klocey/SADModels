#15 - July - 2014

## Items for tonight:

1. Log-normal, done
2. Ken will test

## Stuff Nathan learned
1. escape character i.e. backslash before thingsl like apostrophes
2. how to import modules and from modules to call functions
	
	An Example:
	
	import sys
	
	sys.path.append('/file/path/SADModels')
	import LogNorm as LN
	
	samples = LN.SimLogNorm(N, S, ss)
	
3. Data structure functions: pop, remove, append, extend, insert
4. Assigning value to variable simulataneously, e.g., v, y = [1,2]
5. x -= 1, x += 1



## Next Steps
1. Heat map
	* get SAD samples and find where most of the SADs 'are at'
	* characterizing the feasible of SAD models
2. Get the average shape

3. Diversity, dominance, evenness metrics (Magurran 2004) Smith and Wilson (1996) A consumers guide to evenness metrics.
